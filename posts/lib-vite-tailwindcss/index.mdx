## Introduction

[vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite) and [tailwindcss](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss) are mainly used for application development, but can also be used for library development.
Using vite offers the following advantages:

- Fast preview environment
- Automatic handling of CSS Modules
- Easy use of CSS preprocessors
- Apply path aliases
- Using vite as a Storybook bundler eliminates the need for an extra bundler

For Storybook, you can use the `vite` bandler instead of `webpack`.
For more information, see my previous post [Using Vite for Bandler in Storybook](/posts/storybook-vite/).

The focus of library development is often on the test environment and documentation.
In this article, we'll focus on the library itself, and show you how to create a fast build environment.

We will use the example of react as our code base.
You may also find it useful to look at other frameworks supported by vite.

## Building the environment

The first step is to generate a project skeleton.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn create vite --template react-ts
cd project_name
yarn add -D @types/node
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm init vite@latest --template react-ts
cd project_name
npm i -D @types/node
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

We'll also create the following component as a suitable example component.

Create an entry point, or component, under `src`.

```ts:src/index.ts
export * as SwipeBar from '@/components/swipebar'
```

```tsx:src/components/swipebar.tsx
const Swipebar = (): JSX.Element => {
  return <div className="w-24 h-1 inline-blick bg-gray-200 rounded-full" />
}

export default Swipebar
```

The file structure looks like this:

```bash
.
├── index.html
├── package.json
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   └── swipebar.tsx
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── vite-env.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── vite.config.ts
```

## Configuring path aliases

I haven't seen many projects that use path aliases in their libraries.
However, it's often a good thing, as it means you don't have to modify the import path when refactoring, and it makes the import path easier to find.

I think one of the reasons for the low usage is that `tsc` doesn't resolve path aliases by default when outputting type definition files.
The tool [tsc-alias](https://github.com/justkey007/tsc-alias), which I'll introduce later, resolves path aliases in typedefs.

This solves the problem of path aliases, so first we need to set up a path alias.

The `tsconfig.json` adds the following settings. This will allow VSCode to use IntelliSense for the import path.

```json:tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

Also, `vite.config.ts` should look like this:

```ts:vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'
import { resolve } from 'path'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, 'src')
    }
  },
})
```

## Configure tailwindcss for your library

The next step is to install tailwindcss.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D tailwindcss@next postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
yarn tailwindcss init
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D tailwindcss@next postcss@latest autoprefixer@latest
npm run tailwindcss init
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Tailwindcss needs `postcss` and should be set.

```js:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  }
}
```

Also, import `tailwindcss` in your entry file.

```ts:src/index.ts
import 'tailwindcss/tailwind.css'

export * as SwipeBar from '@/components/swipebar'
```

The example uses `3.0.0-alpha.1`, which is still an alpha release at the time of this writing, but `2.1` or higher with the `JIT` engine is fine.

Now that `tailwind.config.js` has been created, we can edit it.
In order to output CSS for the library, we need to make two changes

- Disable preflight to avoid outputting global scope CSS with side effects
- Set a prefix to adjust the class name output.

Preflight is the default style for tailwindcss, but it is inappropriate to use as a library because it affects the global scope.
Check [base.css](https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@2.2.17/dist/base.css) for the default style generated by Preflight.

Also, if no prefix is used, the generated class name will be the same as the **class name used by the application**.
If the user of the library is using tailwincss and has customized the `theme` field, it is possible to get an unintended style.

In order to deal with this, the `tailwind.config.js` can be modified.

<Alert type="warning">
  If you are using tailwindcss 2 series, the field name is `purge`, not
  `content`.
</Alert>

```js:tailwind.config.js{8-11}
module.exports = {
  jit: true,
  content: ['src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false,
  },
  prefix: 'mylib-'
}
```

The tailwind class name now needs a prefix.

For example, this would look like:

```tsx:src/components/swipebar.tsx
<div className="mylib-w-24 mylib-bg-gray-200" />
```

```css:dist/style.css
.mylib-w-24{width:6rem}
.mylib-bg-gray-200{--tw-bg-opacity: 1;background-color:rgb(229 231 235 / var(--tw-bg-opacity))}
```

CSS custom properties such as `--tw-bg-opacity` should have no side effect, as their scope is closed.

Unfortunately, as a Bandler plugin, it should not be possible to use hash values for prefixes. [^1]

[^1]: maybe `windicss` can do it

So be aware that even with a prefix, there is a chance of duplicate class names.

You can use the following CSS Modules without worrying about that.

## CSS Modules

Vite supports CSS Modules by default.

The `*.module.css` file is recognized as a CSS Modules. [^2]

[^2]: Also supports `.scss` and `.less`. See the [CSS preprocessor](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#css-pre-processors).

Create a file called `swipe.module.css` and add your styles.

```css:src/components/swipe.module.css
.swipebar {
  @apply mylib-w-24 mylib-h-1 mylib-inline-block mylib-bg-gray-200 mylib-rounded-full;
}
```

To use this style, do the following Path aliases can also be used for CSS imports.

```tsx:src/components/swipe.tsx
import { swipebar } from '@/components/swipe.module.css'
const Index = (): JSX.Element => <div className={swipebar} />

export default Index
```

The output from the build will look something like this:

```css:style.css
._swipebar_5xd3q_1{display:inline-block;...}
```

The output is a class name with a hashed suffix.
In fact, if you only use CSS Modules, you don't need to set the tailwindcss prefix.

However, if you use both inline class notation and CSS Modules, it is safer to set the prefix.

### CSS Modules and type declaration

In the case of TypeScript projects, the above import of CSS Modules results in a lint error.
This is because there is no type definition for CSS Modules.

To solve this, you need to create a type definition file. To solve this, we need to create a type declaration file, which can be generated automatically by the CLI.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D typed-css-modules
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D typed-css-modules
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

The `tcm` command will be available.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn tcm src
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm run tcm src
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

You can run it in the format `tcm <input directory>`. This will generate a CSS Modules type definition file.

```ts:swipe.module.css.d.ts
declare const styles: {
  readonly "swipebar": string;
};
export = styles;
```

This allows you to import class names in a type-safe manner.
You can also use the `--watch` argument to monitor files. See [typed-css-modules](https://github.com/Quramy/typed-css-modules) for more information.

## CSS preprocessors

CSS preprocessors such as `.scss` and `.less` are also easily available.
Let's look at an example of using `.scss`.

vite needs to be installed to handle the preprocessor. Also, the `typed-css-modules` mentioned earlier do not support Sass by default.
There is a library called [typed-scss-modules](https://github.com/skovy/typed-scss-modules) that can be used.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D sass typed-scss-modules
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D sass typed-scss-modules
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Let's change the stylesheet to `.scss`.

```tsx:swipe.tsx{1}
import { swipebar } from '@/swipe.module.scss'
const Index = (): JSX.Element => <div className={swipebar} />

export default Index
```

The CLI interface is pretty same.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn tsm src
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm run tsm src
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Now you can use Sass.

vite itself also supports `.less`, and those type declaration can be output with [typed-less-modules](https://github.com/gruckus-gruckus/typed-less-modules).

## Build for libraries

Finally, let's check the build settings for libraries.

First, we need to clean up the external modules in `package.json`

```json:package.json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "react": "^16.8.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "react": "^16.8.0"
  },
  "dependencies": {}
}
```

Move `react` from the `dependencies` field to the `peerDependencies` field.

Also, just writing it in `peerDependencies` will not install it in `node_modules`.
You should also add it to the `devDependencies` field if you need it for development or build.

Next, change `vite.config.ts` to look like this:

```ts:vite.config.ts{9,20}
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { resolve } from 'path'
import { peerDependencies, dependencies } from './package.json'
import plugin from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    plugin({
      'jsxRuntime': 'classic'
    })
  ],
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@': resolve(__dirname, 'src')
    }
  },
  build: {
    lib: {
      entry: resolve(__dirname, 'src', 'index.ts'),
      formats: ['es', 'cjs'],
      fileName: (ext) => `index.${ext}.js`,
      // for UMD name: 'GlobalName'
    },
    rollupOptions: {
      external: [...Object.keys(peerDependencies), ...Object.keys(dependencies)]
    },
    target: 'esnext',
    sourcemap: true
  }
})
```

You can configure builds for libraries in the `lib` field of the `build`.
Also, in the case of the react library, the template for the vite project contains [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/plugin-react#readme).

This will generate bloated code in the form of `jsx-runtime` by default.
As a library, we probably don't see much benefit in `jsx-runtime` style output, so we'll change to classic style output.

### Module format

By default, vite outputs ES Modules and UMDs.
UMDs require a global namespace; to output in UMD format, set the `lib` `name` field to an appropriate name.

In the example above, ES Modules and CommonJS are output.

### Rename the output file

The default filename for the output is `package.json` with `name` + module format + `.js`.

In the example above, this would be `mylib.es.js` and `mylib.cjs.js`.
To change the file name of the output, set the `fileName` of the `lib` field.

This will create the files `index.es.js` and `index.cjs.js` under the `dist` directory.

### Disable dependency bundling

As a rule, libraries should not bundle dependencies. vite bundles all dependencies by default, so we'll disable this.

Specify the list of dependencies you want to exclude in the `external` field of `rollupOptions`.
You can do this by specifying `peerDependencies` and `dependencies` in `package.json`.

### Set the target environment.

You can specify which browser versions and Node.js runtime versions are supported.
The `target` of `build` can be `chrome58`, `node12`, etc. to generate code for that version.

By default, it targets browsers that natively support dynamic ES Moduls import.

### Output source map

Include the source map in your build. The presence of a source map improves UX for library users, e.g. for debugging.

Set the `build` `sourcemap` field to `true`.

With these settings, you can build by running `vite build`.

The output should look something like this:

```bash
.
├── dist
│   ├── index.cjs.js
│   ├── index.cjs.js.map
│   ├── index.es.js
│   ├── index.es.js.map
│   └── style.css
```

## Output type definition files

We recommend using `tsc` and `tsc-alias` to output type definition files.

Path aliases are resolved by using `tsc-alias`.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D tsc-alias
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D tsc-alias
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Change `tsconfig.json` to look like this:

```json:tsconfig.json{17-19}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ESNext",
    "useDefineForClassFields": true,
    "lib": ["DOM", "DOM.Iterable", "ESNext"],
    "allowJs": false,
    "skipLibCheck": false,
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,
    "strict": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "Node",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsxdev",
    "outDir": "dist",
    "declaration": true,
    "declarationMap": true,
    "baseUrl": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["./src"]
}
```

Don't forget to set the `declarationMap` as well.

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn tsc --emitDeclarationOnly
yarn tsc-alias
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm run tsc --emitDeclarationOnly
npm run tsc-alias
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

Output only type definition files with `tsc`. Then overwrite the path alias with `tsc-alias`.

This will result in the following output.

```bash
├── dist
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── swipebar.d.ts
│   │   └── swipebar.d.ts.map
│   ├── index.d.ts
│   └── index.d.ts.map
```

### Run commands in parallel

Build and lint commands tend to be multiple.
If there is no dependency between the order of each command, they can be run in parallel.

Use [npm-run-all](https://github.com/mysticatea/npm-run-all).

<CodeGroups>
  <CodeGroup label="Yarn" active>

```bash
yarn add -D npm-run-all
```

  </CodeGroup>

  <CodeGroup label="NPM">

```bash
npm i -D npm-run-all
```

  </CodeGroup>
</CodeGroups>

The shorthand CLI `npm-run-all` and `run-p` will be available.
An example of a parallel run command might look like this:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "run-p build:*",
    "build:scripts": "vite build",
    "build:types": "tsc --emitDeclarationOnly && tsc-alias",
  }
}
```

The build by vite and the type declaration output are independent, so they can be parallelized.

A `run-s` command is also provided for sequential execution.
However, for short commands, `&&` is sometimes more concise, as above.

## Set the entry point

Finally, we need to set the entry point for `package.json`.

```json:package.json
{
  "main": "dist/index.cjs.js",
  "module": "dist/index.es.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "require": "./dist/index.cjs.js",
      "import": "./dist/index.es.js"
    },
     "./dist/style.css": "./dist/style.css"
  },
  "sideEffects": false,

  "files": [
    "dist"
  ]
}
```

The `module` field should be set to the path of the ES Modules.
The `exports` field should be set to the path of the `.css` file, since we are including CSS files.

The `sideEffects` field can be `false` if your library does not contain any modules that affect global, such as polyfill.
Bundlers such as `webpack` can make better use of tree-shaking.

If it does contain side-effects, see [Mark the file as side-effect-free](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free).

Now you're ready to publish. The only thing left to do is to publish to NPM.

To publish to NPM, please refer to [Publish Typescript Packages with minimal configuration](/posts/typescript-package-release/) which I wrote before.
