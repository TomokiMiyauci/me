## Introduction

With the advent of `esbuild`, the front-end world has become more demanding of speed in the development environment.
The rise of `vite` can be said to be the best of all.

`esbuild` and `swc` are written by the fast `Go` and `Rust`, and more often omit Typescript type checking.
Type checking for `tsc` is usually done in IDEs and workflows, so by stripping them off,
you're specializing in converting to `JavaScript` as a pure compiler.

Now, when testing Typescript code,
it's often [ts-jest](https://github.com/kulshekhar/ts-jest) or [babel-jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-jest) as a transformer.
However, these can slow down the test.

This time, I will show you how to speed up the execution of `Jest` and realize a fast test.

## Conclusion

I will show you about the method first.

```bash
yarn add -D jest @swc/jest
```

```json:jest.config.json
{
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.(t|j)sx?$": "@swc/jest"
  }
}
```

Use `@swc/jest` as the transformer.

## Performance comparison

Let's see how much the performance has improved due to the speedup.

  Since the performance differs depending on the execution environment, I will
  compare the results relative to each other.
</Alert>

### CommonJS + Javascript

Try the pattern that seems to be the fastest in theory.
CommonJS-style JavaScript may be the fastest, as it shouldn't need to be transpiled. (I'm sorry if I made a mistake :pray:)

I'm not interested in the contents of the function, so prepare a suitable function and test it.

```js:index.js
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b
```

```js:test/index.spec.js
const { add } = require('../src')

describe('add', () => {
    it('should return 2 when it gives 1,1', () => {
        const result = add(1,1)
        expect(result).toBe(2)
    })
})
```

```js:jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  testEnvironment: "node",
  roots: ["<rootDir>/test/"]
};
```

Disable the cache and average about 10 times.
It is not a strict measurement, but this time it is a speed comparison of each,
so I think that a relative comparison can be made by matching the conditions.

```bash
for i in {0..9}; do yarn jest --no-cache ; done
```

Result:

| Transformer                   | Mean(s) |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| None（CommonJS + JavaScript） | 0.512   |

I will consider this as a standard.

### ESM + TypeScript

A pattern that describes TypeScript in ES module format. This is the pattern most of the time you use TypeScript.

```ts:index.ts
export const add = (a: number, b: number): number => a + b
```

```ts:test/index.spec.ts
import { add } from '../src/'

describe('add', () => {
    it('should return 2 when it gives 1,1', () => {
        const result = add(1,1)
        expect(result).toBe(2)
    })
})
```

#### Use ts-jest for transformers

```js:jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...,
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'ts-jest',
  }
};

```

Result:

| Transformer                   | Mean(s) |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `ts-jest`                     | 1.660   |
| None（CommonJS + JavaScript） | 0.512   |

It takes about 3 times longer than CommonJS + JavaScript. I want to do something about this.

#### Use esbuild for transformers

[esbuild](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) is a fast bundler written in Go. By default,
Bundler has built-in support for parsing TypeScript syntax and discarding type annotations.

```bash
yarn add -D esbuild-jest esbuild
```

```js:jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...,
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': 'esbuild-jest'
  }
};
```

Result:

| Transformer                   | Mean(s) |
| ----------------------------- | ------- |
| `esbuild-jest`                | 0.373   |
| `ts-jest`                     | 1.660   |
| None（CommonJS + JavaScript） | 0.512   |

It's amazing speed. Surprisingly faster than CommonJS + JavaScript.

#### Use swc for transformers

[swc](https://github.com/swc-project/swc) is an ultra-fast compiler written in rust.
It seems that [Deno](https://github.com/denoland/deno) is also used for `deno lint` and `deno doc`.

```bash
yarn add -D @swc/jest
```

```js:jest.config.js
module.exports = {
  ...,
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.tsx?$': ['@swc/jest'],
  }
};
```

Result:

| Transformer                 | Mean(s) |
| --------------------------- | ------- |
| `@swc/jest`                 | 0.351   |
| `esbuild-jest`              | 0.373   |
| `ts-jest`                   | 1.660   |
| None（CommonJS + JavaScript | 0.512   |

You can see that both `esbuild` and `swc` can be transpiled at incredible speeds.
It is not possible to compare the speed of both with this result alone,
but it seems that `swc` is slightly more advantageous when examined.
However, `esbuild-jest` has the advantage that you can optionally change the following items:

```ts
interface Options {
  jsxFactory?: string
  jsxFragment?: string
  sourcemap?: boolean | 'inline' | 'external'
  loaders?: {
    [ext: string]: Loader
  }
  target?: string
  format?: string
}
```

Also, for VSCode, an extension for [jest](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Orta.vscode-jest) is provided.
This will automatically run the test in the background if there is a change in the test target,
of course this test will also be faster.

If the test is successful, it will nark: white_check_mark: to the target code.
Since the test ends immediately, it is a good development experience to mark it immediately.

## Stop to use jest.config.ts

The above result used `jest.config.js` as the `jest` config file.
However, the `.ts` format configuration file does not improve performance much even if the transformer is changed.

```bash
// @swc/jest + jest.config.js
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.385 s
Ran all test suites.
✨  Done in 1.24s.

// @swc/jest + jest.config.ts
Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       1 passed, 1 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        0.389 s
Ran all test suites.
✨  Done in 2.93s.
```

Just changing the file format to `.ts` has taken more than twice as long.

This is because jest is requesting `ts-node` from the transpiling of `jest.config.ts`.
Therefore, if possible, you should write the configuration file in json format as `jest.config.json`,
or write the configuration file in `jest.config.js` format.

## Cons

As mentioned at the beginning, `esbuild` and `swc` omit type checking and enjoy speed.
Therefore, the following code cannot detect compilation errors during testing.

```ts
export const add = (a: number, b: string): number => a + b
```

In this case, the annotations are inappropriate, but when compiled into JavaScript, it works and passes the test.

That said, most IDEs should display the error visually, and you can prevent it by adding `tsc` to your workflow.
